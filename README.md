# Restaurant Food Search App
This project was built as a means to learn ReactJS using an API.

## Status
Overall, this project is functional but it's a bit incomplete in some parts as I'm currently learning how to manage state with multiple checkboxes and dynamic modals using ReactJS.

The code might not be neat but it does the job, I guess so.

## My approach towards the project
I thought of building a functional UI where the user is allowed to filter the restaurants based on keyword, cuisines and categories. In addition, I thought of fetching restaurants based on current location (by default).

## Tasks:
- [x] Display restaurants based on current location
- [x] Display restaurants based on search
- [x] Display restaurants based on cuisine, locality or category
- [ ] Display restaurant information on a modal
- [x] Sort results by ASC/DESC order based on rating
- [x] Display cuisines in filter box
- [x] Fetch cuisines based on area
- [x] Fetch cities based on geolocation
- [x] Fetch categories
- [x] Make it CSS responsive
- [x] Deploy on Heroku
